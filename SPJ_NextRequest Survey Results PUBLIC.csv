2017/11/28 8:52:49 AM PST,Member of the public,16+,No,,5,Yes,,5,free records. compared to SDUSD's system which requires payment NextRequest is great. in fact. I paid $200 to SDUSD for records which were never produced by SDUSD,it works very well for me
2017/11/28 9:46:49 AM PST,Journalist -- Working for Media Organization,16+,No,,4,No,Sometimes records were released promptly. other times they weren't. My best guess at an average delay would be about a week.,4,It's simple and easily accessible. I also like that all the previous requests are uploaded automatically. Overall. I'd say the NextRequest system has had a net positive effect on transparency and responsiveness.,More staff dedicated to responding to requests. so the city's response time can be reduced. Also more oversight from the City Attorney's Office so that unnecessary/illegal redactions or withholding of records don't happen as often.
2017/11/28 9:49:27 AM PST,Journalist -- Working for Media Organization,5-Jan,No,,2,No,Put a request in September. Still waiting. ,,I like that the process is streamlined. ,It takes way too long to get your request returned.

2017/11/28 12:58:07 PM PST,Journalist -- Working for Media Organization,16+,No,,3,No,"The city often promises to release something ""within two weeks"" or ""next week"" and then doesn't follow up at that time. forcing me to follow up instead. I have multiple requests right now that I'm inquiring about every week or every other week. In multiple cases. I've been waiting for months for the full response.",3,It's easy to make a request and to follow up on them.,"I think the process behind the site is a bigger issue than the site itself. The city can take weeks and even months to respond - whether in full or partially - and sometimes doesn't post all responses provided on the NextRequest. Requestors are often left to repeatedly inquire about requests following promises that they'll be released ""within the next two weeks"" or ""next week."" It can also be challenging to inquire about issues with a request after it's been closed."
2017/11/28 3:20:34 PM PST,Journalist -- Working for Media Organization,10-Jun,No,,4,No,Delayed by a few days,5,,
2017/11/28 3:31:55 PM PST,Journalist -- Working for Media Organization,16+,No,,2,No,In some cases I am still waiting for records to be released. A few other times I was told I would receive records. then was told I would not due to no records being able to be located. After going back to them and asking them to search again. they found records and released them.,4,I like that the information is kept in one place and documented.,I think it should be easier to speak with someone on the phone about your request. sometimes that can make the process easier for all those involved. I also think it would be nice if they were consistent with their policies when it comes to releasing information about the requester. etc. 
2017/11/28 3:43:48 PM PST,Member of the public,16+,No,,5,Yes,,5,ease of making request,the search feature could be better - I searched an address for produced documents and not all came back. same when I searched CAD
2017/11/28 4:43:51 PM PST,Attorney,16+,No,,4,No,Rarely was I given a deadline of any kind to begin with.,4,Transparency of communications.,Showing dates/time stamps of the release of responsive records so there is a clear method of determining which records relate to communications made through the system.  
2017/11/29 10:30:08 AM PST,Journalist -- Working for Media Organization,10-Jun,Yes,Login trouble. Viewing correspondence within the portal is hard and the text is very small. ,2,No,Was told records that existed don't exist. Had to push hard to get city staff to verify the existence of records. Was also denied some records citing unrelated laws.,2,Not much. Emails were better. But it is nice to see all the other requests and records released posted online.,Staff need to do a better job making sure records do not exist before denying a request. It creates a lack of trust. Can also be clearer when records do exist. but are withheld under a legal exemption. Might also be good to provide a clear pathway to appeal denials. with maybe a supervisor contact.

2017/12/01 2:03:45 PM PST,Journalist -- Working for Media Organization,5-Jan,No,,4,Yes,,4,I like that it maintains a constant record of when it was submitted. all interactions with staff. who is in charge of it. and when I might expect the resolution. That saves me a significant amount of time going back and forth with a representative. making sure my request was received. asking who is working on it. etc.,My first request was marked as closed with documents missing and had to be reopened by staff. Requesters aren't given a chance to easily agree or dispute if a request has been satisfactorily completed. 
2017/12/01 5:57:17 PM PST,Journalist -- Working for Media Organization,16+,No,,3,No,Depends on the request. At times the records were released days apart from the actual timeframe given. Other instances - we were quoted within the next week to two weeks and we're now at months with no anticipated time estimate. There have also been times when I've had to remind staff I'm waiting on records - those typically show up pretty quick after that reminder.,3,When the request is simple and with the right department the answers come quickly. The persons responding to requests used to be on top of their game - we could go back and forth with questions and answers - also getting timely updates. More recently I feel like I've had to ask more questions about timing and release info and bother them for responses.  Despite delays - it's still better than San Diego Unified.,Process the requests within the timeframe they've given. Not send completed requests out on Friday evening burning through the 72 hour hold window by news time on monday.
2017/12/03 7:54:34 PM PST,Journalist -- Working for Media Organization,5-Jan,No,,2,Yes,,3,,We need a place where we can see all of our outstanding requests. It's ridiculous to have to search through every request with the city to find yours.

2018/01/05 5:02:12 PM PST,Journalist -- Working for Media Organization,5-Jan,No,,2,No,Not sure. but it was at least several days. or a week or more. after the required request time.,3,It's a convenient system. in theory. And not difficult to fill out and submit a request.,Most importantly. there needs to be a way to contact a city staffer directly and quickly to discuss concerns/questions. etc about a request.

2018/01/05 5:09:52 PM PST,Journalist -- Working for Media Organization,5-Jan,Yes,The request was originally expressed in general terms and the response was 0. Then I resubmitted for specific documents.,1,No,I requested documents that took weeks to receive before I filed a formal request. Then the response for real estate leases and contracts turned out not to be comprehensive and no one was available to interpret the results. ,3,The online submission process was easy to navigate.,"There needs to be department contact who can help navigate through the city documentation system for those of us who are not familiar with the ins and outs of how things are filed and preserved.
I also urge you to seek comments on the San Diego Unified School District's public records management system. I've encountered it once and find it totally at odds with state law and thoroughly nonresponsive."
2018/01/05 5:12:07 PM PST,Activist,5-Jan,No,,4,Yes,,5,The tracking system helps. ,The city assigns a point of contact staffer. but only provides requester with their name.

That deadline is always programatically met.,5,The system automation allows meeting the 10 day response requirement.  What happens after that is a different matter.,It does what it does very well.

I do not like how the information is immediately made public. Perhaps I'm missing something. but I didn't expect my request to be made public. and that should have been made clear to me.
Finally. in one instance I know of. someone requested all the vacation rental addresses in San Diego. and then posted them publically on the web. I think that should not be allowed. (CureSTR.org)"

I'd made requests over the years to get this or that from the SDPD. knowing full well what I'd asked for was within the domain of the Public Information Act and they were required to hand it over. but they would REFUSE to do so. It's truly sickening they got away with it for as many DECADES as they did. but they did. 

The SDPD's hypocrisy would be laughable if it weren't so damaging. Chief Zimmerman is always blathering about how ""transparent"" her department is. She is full of shit and her ""transparent"" lies make me want to smack her; they're intellectually insulting. 

I think the main reason the SDPD got away with it is because whenever I complained to my government representatives about the situation. instead of doing anything. I got a litany of what they COULDN'T do. Instead of looking for causes of action. they dug for excuses NOT to act when apparently they could have--since this portal is now available--they just lacked the WILL to do so.","At first glance it can be a bit confusing because some of the headings are overly broad. If there was a way to ""whittle it down"" a bit to be more specific to exactly what you are looking for that could help. But even when I've made requests under a ""broad"" heading. the personnel who monitor the requests have made sure it gets to the appropriate department."

Due to how responses are provided through the system it would have been better to submit those requests individually.
2018/01/06 8:15:54 AM PST,Member of the public,5-Jan,No,,5,Yes,,5,timeliness of reply.,
2018/01/06 8:56:36 AM PST,Member of the public,5-Jan,No,,3,No,The records were from 1981 and had been removed per city/county policy.,3,,
2018/01/06 9:04:33 AM PST,Private investigator ,5-Jan,No,,1,No,About a two week delay. I did not receive records/ information which I believed to exist ,3,Ease of submitting ,This is a City staff issue more than the system issue
2018/01/06 9:44:29 AM PST,Journalist -- Freelance,10-Jun,No,,5,Yes,I answered 'yes'. but for the most part. depending on whether or not the reports I am seeking were filed by the department (lifeguard activity report),5,It is better than having the department copy me on the weekly reports. as they are understaffed and there is not central PIO. it's more of a shared duty and can be inconsistent. So NextRequest provides a way to secure data for a weekly element in print.,None that I can think of. seems great.
2018/01/06 9:57:17 AM PST,Activist,15-Nov,No,,4,No,No deadline given,4,It’s worked well. but it would be better if the city department in question was more forthcoming with information during scheduled meetings when reports related to the requests are being given.  Reports are verbal only.  Documentation is usually not presented.  ,It would be handy to have a folder of just my requests.  I’ve made more than 40 since 2014. all related to the same topic.  The older requests were fulfilled using compact discs in a format that required specialized software to access.  So. in many respects. this is much better.  
2018/01/06 10:05:24 AM PST,Member of the public,5-Jan,Yes,I was unable to reopen the request since the documents provided were incomplete. I requested a traffic & speed engineering survey & only received a summary. We then went to email to try to resolve the issue. It seemed email was a much faster response than the system. Issue however didn't get resolved because the system said it was closed therefore no longer on the to-do list. If emailed it doesn't make the list so it can be ignored. but if in the system the administrator deciders if a request is resolved even if it isn't. ,2,No,I had to email to get a response,2,I liked how I was able to look up a previous request before submitting my request. It may help to add tags to the documents so we may narrow our search. such as streets in my case. Most people of the public requesting for the first time don't know exactly what they need to search.  such as the name of the document or what's in the document to narrow the search. For example. I didn't know what streets were labeled in the engineering survey so when I searched the name of a main street I found I needed to search the reference streets instead. ,Email conflicts with the process. There's needs to be an SOP & it must be followed. Also.  providing the minimal documentation.  such as summaries rather than the entire document.  given the request is digital.  only makes the request dialogue longer.  more staff time.  & less possibility of showing up in a search for someone else's needs in the future. Therfore summaries take away from the beauty of the system's  intent which is to eventually expedite & save $.
2018/01/06 10:06:17 AM PST,Journalist -- Working for Media Organization,5-Jan,No,,3,Yes,,3,Everything is streamlined and I can see which person and Department is dealing with my request.,There is much less opportunity to go back and forth on requests for clarifications or to discuss how something was searched for. In that way it’s less transparent and makes it more difficult to ensure you receive what you’re looking for.
2018/01/06 10:11:28 AM PST,Commercial research,16+,No,,3,No,"Generally received the records. not always timely. And. the City tends to ""inadvertently"" interpret very specific requests incorrectly - particularly when it doesn't want to release information",2,Submittal is relatively simple,"A requestor ought to be able challenge or. at a minimum. comment on a ""closed"" request.  On more than one occasion. the City has deemed a request ""closed"" when it had not produced the records or had ""inadvertently"" produced incomplete or completely wrong records in response to a very specific request. If the City is being measured on closed requests. this number is skewed."
2018/01/06 10:14:40 AM PST,Member of the public,5-Jan,No,,2,No,Did not provide complete details so needed to go back,2,Compared to other City services in San Diego (ie SDPD dispatch. SDPD traffic. etc) this one works relatively well (that being said in any other city it wourld be considered substandard) ,Sometime hard for public to know how documents are filed so additional interaction would be good 
2018/01/06 10:20:04 AM PST,Member of the public,5-Jan,Yes,They said It was not in their jurisdiction to give me info. They said they were only for SDPD and I was inquiring about Chula Vista police.  Chula Vista police said they could not release info and then transferred me to a department that handles the release of info. She too said I cannot have the info I requested . which was a police report and 911 audio call. It wasn't until I gave them the law or the code number that made it law for them to release info to any public citizen requesting it.. at this point . she referred me to the site . Next Request. But she must have known it was only for San Diego and not Chula Vista. ,1,No,The actuall person responding from next request was actually very quick to respond and informative. It's Chula Vista pd that is not up to par ,4,,

2018/01/06 10:51:44 AM PST,Member of the public,5-Jan,No,,3,Yes,,2,The response time in regards to what I've requested was good. but on one occasion I was asked to discuss the question and my answers were not forthcoming. I felt that my questions were ones that the city didn't want to answer. so they had a dept head call and discuss my questions with me.,Any and all questions grom the piblic should be responded to in writing. othetwise it makes the requestor fill like they're asking questions staff doesn't want to answer or some other nefarious reason.

2018/01/06 1:51:46 PM PST,Land Use Planning consultant,5-Jan,Yes,the system gagged on a request for files from the 1970s,2,No,i had to call twice over a 3 week period to get a supervisor to get the old files from archives,3,This new system may work for some records from the last couple years. but only because i have worked with the City for 40 years. did i not give up. badgering the staff till i got what i knew they had.,Make it embrace ALL the records of Council actions. ever.
2018/01/06 3:03:23 PM PST,Member of the public,5-Jan,No,,4,No,They were released well before the estimated delivery date.,4,Hard to say.  I used it once.  It worked.  Not much else to say about it. ,1) No Comment about the NR system.  2) Members of the media might do what I do to get information - develop and maintain a large group of “friends in low places” across the City staff who can provide information; but don’t say you’re in the media.  You’re anathema with City staff because they don’t want to help you and then be outed for having done it.  Said straightforwardedly. I protect my friends in low places who in turn keep me abreast of what’s happening at the City in the departments that interest me. all without resort to the formal NextRequest system.
2018/01/06 3:03:33 PM PST,Member of the public,5-Jan,Yes,"document was reported ""unavailable "" and I would have to get back to them on my request",1,No,did not receive the record,2,,web site and request process very difficult and slow
2018/01/06 3:28:09 PM PST,Attorney. for use in information gathering. lawsuits. and public bidding on public works projects,16+,No,,3,No,For the most part. records were released in a timely manner.  However. in a few instances. I would be waiting for weeks (2-3) after the coordinator told me I would records.  Further. when I tried to follow up. I would get no response.  This problem. in my opinion. is not attributable to the individual City departments and employees who handle the request.  ,4,Having an online database where the responsive documents are produced is helpful.  Further. having each file appropriately named makes it easier to organize.  ,"It is hard to get in contact with the representative who is handling my requests.  I understand the NextRequest was created to put a layer between citizens and departments and to have NextRequest representatives work on the request.  However. as an attorney particularly. sometimes the issues are time sensitive.  When I do other public records requests throughout the State. I am able to contact the coordinator directly via phone or email.  The NextRequest system only allows us to leave a message for our coordinator.  This problem may be unique to my situation. but I feel like more direct access to those gathering the documents would be helpful.  Further. if production is made and somethings are missing. I typically send and email with attachments and hyperlinks to show which documents still need to be produced.  However. with the NextRequest message system. I cannot do that and it makes it harder to communicate which documents the City still needs to be produced.  Finally. a lot of what I do concerns Public Works Construction Projects owned by the City.  Specifically. competitive bidding and ensuring City compliance with the municipal code.  When a project is awarded. often times the losing bidders protest the winning bid to get the City to award to someone else.  This ""protest"" process requires entities. and their attorneys like me. procure the CIty's Project Documents. other bids. and City regulations specific to that Project. all of which are public records under California law.  The City requires all protests to be submitted within 10 days of award on any project.  With such a short window. getting documents as soon as we can is essential.  As set forth above. the NextRequest system makes it difficult to contact a representative to ensure prompt production of records.  The typical fact pattern for me is that I submit my request. it takes a day or two to assign to a representative. then another day or two for that representative to coordinate with the proper department. and by the time I get the documents. or a response from my representative. I only have a short window to analyze and draft our protest.  In short. more access to the representative handling the request would be useful.
